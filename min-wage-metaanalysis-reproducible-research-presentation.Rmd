## Introduction

- the main goal of this project was to reproduce the results of a well-cited meta-analysis

Card, David, and Alan B Krueger. 1995. “Time-Series Minimum-Wage Studies: A Meta-Analysis.” The American Economic Review 85 (2)

- and to extent the research by adding more studies:

Bernstein, Jared, and John Schmitt. 2000. “The Impact of the Minimum Wage.” Economic Policy Institute.

Bazen, Stephen, and Velayoudom Marimoutou. 2002. “Looking for a Needle in a Haystack? A Re-Examination of the Time Series Relationship Between Teenage Employment and Minimum Wages in the United States.” Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics 64

- full repository of the project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakubyler/MinimumWageStudies_ReproducibleResearch)

- requirements to re-run the obtained results are:

`R version 4.0.5`, `rmarkdown 2.8.0`, `tidyverse 1.3.1`, `stargazer 5.2.2`

## Reproducing the Results (1/4)

- we needed to look for various statistics not only in the Card and Krueger meta-analysis, but in supporting papers as well as in original sources

- we found data for all 15 papers, but failed to reproduce `teenager sub-group` binary variable, due to lack of available information

- we successfully reproduced the original visualizations, general regression model specifications as well as supporting models based on subsets of original dataset

## Reproducing the Results (2/4)

**\footnotesize Figure 1. Estimated t-statistics compared to Degrees of Freedom**

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_1_old
```

\tiny Note: Presented sample is the one analysed by Card and Krueger. The fitted regression line is simple linear model with 95 pct. confidence intervals.

## Reproducing the Results (3/4)

**\footnotesize Figure 2. Estimated Employment Elasticity compared to Standard Error Estimate**

```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_2_old
```

\tiny Note: Presented sample is the one analysed by Card and Krueger. The fitted regression line is simple linear model with 95 pct. confidence intervals. Line without confidence intervals represent the Standard Error multiplied by 2.

## Reproducing the Results (4/4)

**\footnotesize Table 1. Regression Models for the Logarithm of Absolute t-statistics of Minimum Wage Emplyoment Effect**

```{r, include = F}
tbl1 = stargazer(model_1_old, model_2_old, model_3_old, type = 'latex', digits = 2, header = F,
                 font.size = 'footnotesize', no.space = TRUE)
tbl1 = sub('^.+\\caption.+$','', tbl1)
```

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis', out.width = 6, out.height = 4}
cat(tbl1, sep = '\n')
```

\tiny Note: The sample used to estimate regression models is the same as in original meta-analysis by Card and Krueger. The binary variable for teenager sub-sample was removed, due to lack of information available to authors.

## Extending the Meta-Analysis (1/4)

- we added two new papers published after 1995 (year of original meta-analysis publication)

- results are in line with the original conclusions, and nearly are well fitted to the found biases

## Extending the Meta-Analysis (2/4)

**\footnotesize Figure 3. Estimated t-statistics compared to Degrees of Freedom (Extended)**
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_1_new
```

\tiny Note: Presented sample is the one analysed by Card and Krueger extended by two additional studies published after the publication of the original meta-analysis. The fitted regression line is simple linear model with 95 pct. confidence intervals. Blue colour indicates the studies added to the reproduced original meta-analysis by Card and Krueger.

## Extending the Meta-Analysis (3/4)

**\footnotesize Figure 4. Estimated Employment Elasticity compared to Standard Error Estimate (Extended)**
```{r, warning = F, message = F, echo = F, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4}
fig_2_new
```

\tiny Note: Presented sample is the one analysed by Card and Krueger extended by two additional studies published after the publication of the original meta-analysis. The fitted regression line is simple linear model with 95 pct. confidence intervals. Line without confidence intervals represent the Standard Error multiplied by 2. Blue colour indicates the studies added to the reproduced original meta-analysis by Card and Krueger.

## Extending the Meta-Analysis (4/4)

**\footnotesize Table 2. Regression Models for the Logarithm of Absolute t-statistics of Minimum Wage Emplyoment Effect (Extended)**

```{r, include = F}
tbl2 = stargazer(model_1_new, model_2_new, model_3_new, type = 'latex', digits = 2, header = F,
                 font.size = 'footnotesize', no.space = TRUE)
tbl2 = sub('^.+\\caption.+$','', tbl2)
```

```{r, echo = F, results = 'asis'}
cat(tbl2, sep = '\n')
```

\tiny Note: The sample used to estimate regression models is the same as in original meta-analysis by Card and Krueger extended by two additional studies published after the publication of the original meta-analysis. The binary variable for teenager sub-sample was removed, due to lack of information available to authors.

## Conclusions

- there is strong evidence that research is often biased

- the over-trust in available literature can be misleading

- researchers, who trust biased science could perform analyses that might have low scientific value due to bias rooted in the predecessors’ work
